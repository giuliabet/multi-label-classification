# multi-label-classification
Multi-label classification problem with CelebA Dataset.

In this section the problem of Multi-label classification is analyzed by using traditional Deep Learning models. The goal is to evaluate the different techniques regarding multi-label scenarios and try to understad their strengths and limitations. Through metrics and performances' evaluation, the research aims to define their implementationa and identify optimizazion areas.

The exploited dataset focus on hair color attributes: brown, blonde and black.

The models used are:

- CNN
- ResNet
- Transformers
